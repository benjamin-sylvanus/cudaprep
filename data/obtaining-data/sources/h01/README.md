The H01 dataset can be viewed online via Neuroglancer.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
[Neuroglancer](https://github.com/google/neuroglancer) is a WebGL-based viewer for volumetric data. It is capable of displaying arbitrary (non axis-aligned) cross-sectional views of volumetric data, as well as 3-D meshes and line-segment based models (skeletons).

Data can be downloaded using the Google Colab Notebooks provided by H01 or our sample notebook. &#x20;
