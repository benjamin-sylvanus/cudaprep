## Reader needs map implementation

Change dt of Data Members of Simulation class.
New dt should be Variant<T> * 
Reader can then store all data in map and dynamically assign values in constructor

Or we can get rid of the simulation class def and point to the map keys

## Verify Cuda Unified memory Model works on server. 

Clone branch and run. 

If it works rebase main onto this branch 

Could perform benchmarking or profiling to compare performance.

## Figure out gpuErrchk on this branch 

## Try installing qt app on the server and running with mapped model.
